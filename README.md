### Hiya!
Here's my quickbits:
- I work for Red Hat on their Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes addon for OpenShift!
- I've been interested in Open Source since college, and recently finally started contributing!
- Check out my pins for the projects I'm most proud of (they're not necessarily all my most complex)

I've added holopins because I got one for participating in ðŸŽƒ Hacktoberfest ðŸŽƒ
